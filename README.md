BubbleDone: A Neural Task Manager
===

BubbleDone is a task manager that models the flow of thoughts more efficiently
than a simple list. Each task is a bubble that surrounds a central attractor,
like planets orbiting a star. When you finish a task, you can throw it into the
attractor, which sends it spiraling off into space, never to cloud your mind
again.

Tasks can be moved closer to and further away from the central attractor,
representing how important those tasks are to you. Whereas most task managers
remind you constantly about tasks you have yet to finish, BubbleDone simply
encourages you to finish the tasks in the center, rather than cluttering your
notification screen with incessant reminders.

BubbleDone was created for HackTX by Rohan Ramchand
