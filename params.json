{"name":"Bubbledone","tagline":"A Neural Task Manager","body":"BubbleDone: A Neural Task Manager\r\n===\r\n\r\n![Different Tasks](./screenshots/screen2.png)\r\n\r\n![Looking at Task](./screenshots/screen4.png)\r\n\r\nBubbleDone is a task manager that models the flow of thoughts more efficiently\r\nthan a simple list. Each task is a bubble that surrounds a central attractor,\r\nlike planets orbiting a star. When you finish a task, you can throw it into the\r\nattractor, which sends it spiraling off into space, never to cloud your mind\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTasks can be moved closer to and further away from the central attractor,\r\nrepresenting how important those tasks are to you. Whereas most task managers\r\nremind you constantly about tasks you have yet to finish, BubbleDone simply\r\nencourages you to finish the tasks in the center, rather than cluttering your\r\nnotification screen with incessant reminders.\r\n\r\nBubbleDone was created for HackTX by\r\nRohan Ramchand ([@rohan](http://github.com/rohan)),\r\nPato Lankenau ([@pato](http://github.com/pato)),\r\nTres Popp ([@tpopp](http://github.com/tpopp)),\r\nand Will Yager ([@wyager](http://github.com/wyager)),\r\nall University of Texas\r\nat Austin Class of 2017.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
